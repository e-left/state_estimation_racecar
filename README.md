# turtle_estimation: ROS2 Node for Formula Student Autonomous State Estimation

This repo contains the complete ROS2 Node implementation for performing State Estimation on a Formula Student Autonomous racecar in real time. It is written in C++ and the current setup receives data from motor resolvers located on the rear driving wheels, hall effect rotation sensors located on the front non-driven wheels, steering data from a rotational potentiometer on the pinion of the steering system, acceleration and brake pedal data obtained from the pedals and from the brake pressure sensor, and velocity (linear and angular) and acceleration data from an Inertial Navigation System sensor. Data fusion is performed by an Extended Kalman Filter system, and care has been taken for the system's runtime performance utilizing parallelization.
